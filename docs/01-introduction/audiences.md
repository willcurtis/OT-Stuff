# Audiences

This manual is targeted at **network engineers working within Operational Technology (OT) and Building Management Systems (BMS)** environments. It also benefits adjacent roles that interact with OT networks.

---

## Primary Audience

### **Network Engineers (OT/BMS Focus)**
Individuals responsible for:

- Designing OT networks for new builds or refurbishments.  
- Maintaining existing OT/BMS infrastructure.  
- Troubleshooting communication issues between controllers, gateways, and supervisory systems.  
- Implementing secure remote access.  
- Ensuring resilience and compliance with cyber-security requirements (e.g., NIS2).

This manual provides the depth required to be effective in OT environments while building on existing IT networking expertise.

## Secondary Audiences

### **OT Engineers / BMS Integrators**
While the manual is not written from a controls-engineering perspective, OT engineers benefit from:

- Understanding how network design impacts control system performance.  
- Knowing how to communicate requirements to IT teams.  
- Identifying whether faults originate in networking or controls logic.

### **OT Security Architects**
Professionals designing security controls for operational networks gain:

- Protocol-level insights into BACnet, Modbus, and MS/TP.  
- Security weaknesses inherent in legacy systems.  
- Recommendations for hardening remote access pathways.

### **Building Operators and Facilities Managers**
This manual helps them:

- Understand why BMS networks require segmentation.  
- Recognise risks introduced by legacy equipment and weak access control.  
- Communicate operational priorities effectively to network teams.

# Who Should Not Use This Manual?

This manual is **not for**:

- Mechanical engineers seeking plant-control theory.  
- Software developers writing BMS applications or analytics platforms.  
- Sales or commercial staff requiring high-level summaries.  

This manual assumes strong technical competence in networking and focuses on applied OT/BMS knowledge.
